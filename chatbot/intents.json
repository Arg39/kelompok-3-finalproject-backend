UX, on the other hand, stands for User Experience, which is more about the overall experience a user has while interacting with a product, including factors like ease of use, efficiency, and emotional impact.",
      "In simpler terms, UI is what users see and interact with directly, while UX is the overall feeling users have while using a product. Both UI and UX design are essential for creating products that are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and enjoyable to use."
